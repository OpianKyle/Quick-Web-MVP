Build a lightweight MVP web app in one Replit project called **“SA Government – SMME Platform”** using **React (Vite) + Node/Express** with a simple **SQLite** database (or JSON file DB if SQLite is hard). Keep it SMALL and fast to generate.

## Look & Branding

* Government portal style UI (clean cards, simple forms, mobile-first)
* SA colours theme:

  * Green #007A4D, Gold #FFB81C, Black #111111, Red #DE3831, Blue #002395, Background #F6F7F9
* Header with crest placeholder + title “SA Government – SMME Digital Enablement”

## Users (simple)

* Roles: **Admin** and **SME**
* Admin can issue vouchers + view basic stats
* SME can register, redeem voucher, generate website draft, generate 3 social posts, and create an invoice PDF

## MVP Features Only

### 1) SME Registration

* Fields: business name, owner name, phone, email, location, industry, products/services
* POPIA consent checkbox (required)

### 2) Voucher System (must work)

* Subscription price: **R899/month**
* Voucher gives **6 months active access**
* Admin creates voucher codes (batch size input) and can download/export list
* SME redeems a code → sets subscription active for 6 months from today
* Show SME “days remaining”

### 3) “Website Builder” (simple AI text generation)

* SME answers 5 quick questions (industry, services, location, hours, style)
* Backend generates a website draft (hero/about/services/contact + SEO title/description)
* Show preview page + publish to `/site/:slug`

### 4) Social Media Drafts

* Generate 3 posts (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) from the business profile + website draft
* SME can edit and click “Copy/Export” (no real posting to APIs)

### 5) Invoicing + PDF

* Simple invoice form (customer, items, total)
* Generate downloadable PDF invoice (pdf-lib)

## AI (optional but supported)

* If OPENAI_API_KEY exists in .env, use it for generation
* If no key, use mocked template content so the app still works

## Deliverables

* Working login (basic email+password) with role-based routing
* Minimal dashboards:

  * Admin: create vouchers, view total SMEs, redeemed vouchers
  * SME: profile, voucher status, website builder, social drafts, invoices
* Seed users: 1 admin + 1 SME
* README with setup/run instructions

Build it with a clean folder structure: `/client` (React) and `/server` (Express). Make sure it runs on Replit with one “Run” button.
